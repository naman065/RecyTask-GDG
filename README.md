# RecyTask-GDG
* Created a basic static webpage showing the countdown timer and the portfolio keeping the layout
same as the one provided
* For the logic behind the countdown i have uploaded the code along with the readme
* Its subtracting the current time from 1st January 2025 and calculating d,h,m,s mathematicallly

# Styling
* Instead of using colored bgs, I have used an image as a background and the preview button shows the required message
* I have used the flex based layout design for countdown and portfolio part
# Bonus
* I have added a dynamic clock showing the current time ( I made it while lerning reactjs in summers)
